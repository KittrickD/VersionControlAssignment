Our code prompts the user for a string a int.
The code then combines the name and number to use as a username on some website.

The following is an example of how to use our code:
'''name = input('Insert your name!')
Jack
integer = int(input('Insert an integer!')) 
77

username = name + str(integer) 
print("This here is your created username!:", username)
Jack77'''

For our Code of Conduct we went with the Contributor Convenant because its widely used, simple and reflects our values. It outlines a welcoming enviroment for everyone to contribute, examples of unacceptable behavior, enforcement guidelines of violations and who to report violations to.
